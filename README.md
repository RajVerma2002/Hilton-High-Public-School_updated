Overview
This school website is created using a combination of various web technologies to provide a comprehensive learning experience. The main technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
HTML: The backbone of the website, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure and content of the web pages. It defines the elements and layout, ensuring that the content is organized and accessible.
CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements. It is responsible for the visual presentation of the website, including layout design, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. CSS ensures that the website is visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. It allows for real-time updates, form validations, animations, and other interactive features that enhance the user experience.
PHP: PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language used to manage the backend operations of the website. It handles data processing, form submissions, and server-side logic, enabling the website to interact with the server and databases.
SQL: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for database management. It allows for the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data within the database. SQL is essential for managing student records, grades, and other school-related data efficiently.
